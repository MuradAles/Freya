# Product Requirements Document: Recording System

**Feature:** Video Screen, Camera, and Audio Recording  
**Project:** Freya (ClipForge) - Desktop Video Editor  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Priority:** üî¥ Critical for MVP

---

## 1. Introduction/Overview

Currently, Freya allows users to import existing media files for editing but lacks the ability to create new recordings directly within the application. This feature adds a **Recording Mode** where users can capture:

- **Screen recordings** (full screen, specific window, or custom area)
- **Camera recordings** (webcam with positionable overlay)
- **Audio recordings** (microphone only)
- **Combined recordings** (screen + camera + audio in one file)

**Goal:** Enable users to create and import recordings directly in Freya, eliminating the need to record in external applications.

---

## 2. Goals

1. **Recording Mode** - Add a separate "Recorder" mode distinct from "Editor" mode
2. **Screen Recording** - Capture screen content with custom area selection (like snipping tool)
3. **Camera Recording** - Record webcam feed with customizable position on screen
4. **Audio Recording** - Record microphone input (with or without video)
5. **Device Selection** - Allow users to choose specific screens, cameras, and microphones
6. **Live Preview** - Show what's being recorded in real-time
7. **Automatic Import** - Save recordings to media library after completion
8. **Seamless Workflow** - Switch from Recorder mode to Editor mode with recordings ready to use

---

## 3. User Stories

### As a content creator:
1. **As a user**, I want to record my screen so I can create tutorials and demonstrations
2. **As a user**, I want to record my screen with my camera overlay so I can appear on camera during tutorials
3. **As a user**, I want to record a specific window only so I don't capture unnecessary content
4. **As a user**, I want to record a custom screen area so I can focus on specific parts of my screen
5. **As a user**, I want to add my microphone to any recording so viewers can hear me
6. **As a user**, I want to choose which microphone to use so I can use my preferred audio device
7. **As a user**, I want to see live preview while recording so I know what I'm capturing
8. **As a user**, I want my recordings to automatically appear in my media library so I can start editing immediately

## 6. Design Considerations

### 6.1 Visual Design

#### Mode Switcher (Header)
- Top bar: Fixed position, always visible
- Mode buttons: Pill-shaped, active mode highlighted purple
- Icons: üìù (editor), üé• (recorder)

#### Recorder Entry Screen
- Large, prominent buttons (at least 200x200px each)
- Icons: üì∫ (screen), üì∑ (camera), üé§ (audio)
- Centered layout, good spacing
- Dark theme consistent with Editor mode

#### Recording Status
- Recording indicator: üî¥ Red dot (animated pulse effect)
- Timer: Large, visible (at least 24px font)
- Preview area: Centered, takes most of screen space
- Stop button: Red background, large, easily accessible

### 6.2 User Experience

#### Recording Flow
1. User clicks "Recorder" mode
2. Selects recording type (Screen/Camera/Audio)
3. Configures devices and options
4. Starts recording
5. Records with live preview
6. Stops recording
7. Saves to location
8. Auto-imports to library
9. Returns to Editor mode

#### Error Handling
- If no camera available: Disable "Record Camera" button
- If no microphone available: Still allow recording (without audio)
- If permissions denied: Show clear error message
- If file save fails: Show error, keep blob in memory, allow retry

#### Feedback
- Visual: Red indicator, timer, preview
- Audio: Optional beep when recording starts/stops
- Loading: "Saving..." indicator during save process
- Success: Highlight new file in media library

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Electron Desktop Capture
```typescript
// Get screen/window sources (main process)
const sources = await desktopCapturer.getSources({
  types: ['screen', 'window']
});

// Stream in renderer
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  video: {
    mandatory: {
      chromeMediaSource: 'desktop',
      chromeMediaSourceId: sourceId,
    }
  }
});
```

### 7.2 Camera & Microphone Capture
```typescript
// Get user media (renderer process)
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  video: true,      // camera
  audio: true        // microphone
});
```

### 7.3 MediaRecorder API
```typescript
// Create recorder
const mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream, {
  mimeType: 'video/webm;codecs=vp9'
});

// Record chunks
const chunks: Blob[] = [];
mediaRecorder.ondataavailable = (e) => chunks.push(e.data);

// Stop and save
mediaRecorder.onstop = () => {
  const blob = new Blob(chunks, { type: 'video/webm' });
  // Save blob to file
};
```

### 7.4 Custom Area Selection
```typescript
// Use HTML5 Canvas to draw overlay
// Mouse events to handle click and drag
// Calculate coordinates: { x, y, width, height }
// Use with desktopCapturer to crop the recorded area
```

### 7.5 Camera Overlay (Screen + Camera)
```typescript
// Composite using HTML5 Canvas
// Draw screen stream to canvas
// Draw camera stream at specified position
// Record combined canvas stream
```

### 7.6 File Structure Changes
```
src/
  components/
    Recorder/
      RecorderMode.tsx          - Main recorder page
      ScreenRecordingDialog.tsx - Screen setup dialog
      CameraRecordingDialog.tsx - Camera setup dialog
      AudioRecordingDialog.tsx  - Audio setup dialog
      RecordingPreview.tsx       - Live preview component
      CustomAreaSelector.tsx     - Snipping tool interface
    App.tsx                      - Add mode switcher
  hooks/
    useRecording.ts              - Recording logic
    useCustomArea.ts             - Custom area selection
  electron/
    ipc/
      recordingHandlers.ts       - IPC handlers
```

### 7.7 State Management
```typescript
// Add to uiStore or create recordingStore
interface RecordingState {
  isRecording: boolean;
  recordingType: 'screen' | 'camera' | 'audio' | null;
  selectedSources: {
    screen?: string;
    camera?: string;
    microphone?: string;
  };
  cameraPosition: string; // 'TL', 'TC', 'TR', etc.
  customArea?: { x, y, width, height };
  timer: number; // seconds
}
```

## 8. Success Metrics

1. **User Success Rate:** >90% of users can successfully record screen, camera, and audio within 5 minutes
2. **Recording Quality:** Recordings play smoothly without stuttering or dropped frames
3. **File Size:** Recordings do not exceed reasonable file sizes (<100MB for 5-minute 1080p)
4. **Save Success Rate:** >95% of recordings save successfully without errors
5. **Import Rate:** Recordings automatically appear in media library 100% of the time
6. **User Satisfaction:** Users report recording feature as intuitive and easy to use

---

## 9. Edge Cases

1. **No Cameras Available:** Disable "Record Camera" button, show message
2. **No Microphones Available:** Still allow recording, just mark microphone unavailable
3. **Permissions Denied:** Show clear error: "Please allow screen recording access"
4. **Large Recording (>1 hour):** Warn user: "Large file will take time to save"
5. **Disk Space Full:** Catch error, show: "Not enough disk space to save recording"
6. **Window Closed During Recording:** Handle gracefully, save partial recording
7. **Multiple Monitors:** Let user select which screen to record
8. **Camera Selected Then Disconnected:** Detect and pause recording with error
9. **Microphone Selected Then Disconnected:** Detect and continue recording (show warning)
10. **Recording While Editing:** Switch to Editor mode automatically pauses recording

---

## 10. Open Questions

1. **Recording Format:** Should we use WebM (recommended) or MP4?
   - **Decision:** WebM for compatibility, MP4 conversion in export
2. **Maximum Recording Duration:** Should there be a limit?
   - **Decision:** No limit, but warn if >1 hour
3. **Recording Quality:** Should users be able to choose quality settings?
   - **Decision:** Use system default (high quality), no settings for MVP
4. **Auto-add to Timeline:** Should recordings automatically appear on timeline?
   - **Decision:** No, just add to library (user drags to timeline)
5. **Save Location:** Should we remember last save location?
   - **Decision:** Yes, use last location or default to Videos folder
6. **Multiple Audio Sources:** Can users record from multiple microphones?
   - **Decision:** No, select one microphone at a time
7. **Recording While Minimized:** Should recording continue?
   - **Decision:** Yes, recording continues in background
8. **Cancel During Recording:** Should there be a discard option?
   - **Decision:** No, must stop and save (too risky to lose work)
