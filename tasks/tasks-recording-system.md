### Notes

- Use MediaRecorder API in renderer process (not main process) for performance
- Use Electron's desktopCapturer.getSources() to list available screens/windows
- Custom area selection uses click-and-drag interface similar to snipping tool
- Canvas compositing for screen + camera overlay during recording
- Record to WebM format for browser compatibility
