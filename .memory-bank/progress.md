## Known Issues

### Development Issues

1. **Thumbnail Generation Slow**
   - **Issue:** Generating thumbnails for videos is async and slow
   - **Impact:** UI blocks during import
   - **Priority:** Medium
   - **Fix:** Add loading states, async thumbnails

2. **Media Display Without Thumbnails**
   - **Issue:** Media items show without thumbnails
   - **Impact:** Poor UX, can't see media
   - **Priority:** High
   - **Fix:** Complete thumbnail generation

3. **Preview Not Loading**
   - **Issue:** Video player not receiving video source
   - **Impact:** Can't preview imported media
   - **Priority:** High
   - **Fix:** Connect media selection to video player

### Minor Issues

1. **DevTools Console Errors**
   - Autofill errors (harmless, dev-only)
   - **Fix:** Comment out `openDevTools()` or add error handler

2. **No Error Handling**
   - Missing try-catch blocks in file operations
   - **Fix:** Add error boundaries and user-friendly messages

## Recent Changes

### Last Session Accomplishments

1. **Created Core Components**
   - Sidebar, MediaGrid, MediaItem
   - PreviewCanvas, VideoPlayer, PlaybackControls
   - Timeline structure

2. **Implemented State Management**
   - MediaStore with CRUD operations
   - TimelineStore with track management
   - UIStore for UI state

3. **Started File Import**
   - Drag & drop handlers
   - File validation
   - Path storage

### Current Work

**Active Development:**
- Completing thumbnail generation for imported files
- Connecting media selection to video player
- Implementing timeline clip rendering

## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers

1. **Thumbnail Generation Complexity**
   - **Block:** Need to extract video frames, audio waveforms
   - **Impact:** Can't display media properly
   - **Mitigation:** Implement basic thumbnail generation

2. **IPC Testing**
   - **Block:** Need to test file dialog from renderer
   - **Impact:** Import might not work
   - **Mitigation:** Test IPC communication

### Schedule Risks

1. **Timeline Development**
   - **Risk:** Timeline is complex, might take longer
   - **Mitigation:** Start simple (single track, basic drag-drop)

2. **Export Pipeline**
   - **Risk:** FFmpeg integration is complex
   - **Mitigation:** Start with single-clip export, add complexity later

3. **Recording Feature**
   - **Risk:** Recording APIs are platform-specific
   - **Mitigation:** Start with screen recording only (simpler)

### Critical Path

**To reach MVP, must complete:**
1. File import with thumbnails ← Current
2. Preview connection ← Current
3. Timeline drag & drop ← Next
4. Trim functionality ← After timeline
5. FFmpeg export ← Last feature
